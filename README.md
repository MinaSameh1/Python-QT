This is a quick program to test sqlalchemy and GUI out.

I wanted to try out pyqt5 and tkinter, so I made this quick program, it isn't meant to be taken seriously, I tried also making everything be "clean" but I gave up half way as this is just a test for something and all the GUI code is in main now.
